The following [survey](http://goo.gl/forms/uIn1REwRkwb0nUft1) will be conducted by the teacher during class time to you and your ICS 3C and 3U peers. 

  1. On a scale from 0 to 10, how fun is programming?
  2. What percentage of the software development process would you estimate is spent writing code?

You will be given the results in the form of a spreadsheet. Using the knowledge you've acquired from this course, store the information in two different ways so that they can be used in Python programs. 

Write programs to determine at least **five** of the following in **two different ways** each:
>>>>>>> Added culminating readme

* The median result in response to the first question.
* The mode (i.e., most common) result in response to the first question.
* The average result in response to the second question.
* The most common word that is at least 6 letters long in response to the third question.
* The three most common words in response to the fourth question.
* The student(s) who wrote the highest total number of characters in their responses.
* The student(s) who wrote the lowest total number of characters in their responses.


###Part 2
<<<<<<< HEAD
Write a reflection paper about your process in Part 1. In fewer than 200 words total, respond to **all** the following:

  1. Which way of storing data allowed for easiest access? Why?

Write a reflection paper about your process in Part 1. In fewer than 200 words, respond to the following:

  1. Which way of storing data was easiest? Why?
>>>>>>> Added culminating readme
  2. Which of the five tasks was the most challenging? Why?
  3. Discuss some of the planning and debugging strategies you used to overcome challenges when writing your programs.


###Part 3

<<<<<<< HEAD
In fewer than 300 words total, respond to **all** of the following:

  1. Which computer peripheral device do you use the most? Find three computer tasks that cannot be accomplished without this device. Why can't these three tasks be done without this device?
  2. What are the stages in the software development life cycle "waterfall model"? Which stage do you think would take the most time in a software project? Why?
  3. Name two negative effects of computer use on the environment. Select one of the negative effects and explain what you can do to reduce this effect. (Do not choose paper waste as a negative effect.)
  4. Name two negative effects of computer use on human health. Select one of the negative effects and explain what you can do to avoid it.
